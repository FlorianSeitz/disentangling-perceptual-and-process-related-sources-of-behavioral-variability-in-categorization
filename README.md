### Abstract
People often categorize the same object variably over time. Such intraindividual behavioral variability is difficult to identify because it can be confused with a bias and can originate in different categorization steps. The current work discusses possible sources of behavioral variability in categorization, focusing on perceptual and cognitive processes, and reports a simulation with a similarity-based categorization model to disentangle these sources. The simulation showed that noise during perceptual or cognitive processes led to considerable misestimations of a response determinism parameter. The category responses could not discriminate between the different forms of noise because different forms of noise led to similar response patterns. However, the continuous model predictions could identify the noise: Noisy feature perception led to variable predictions for central stimuli on the category boundary, noisy feature attention increased the prediction variability for stimuli differing from each category on another feature, and noisy similarity computation increased the variability for stimuli with moderate predictions. Measuring category beliefs in a continuous way (e.g., through category probability judgments) may therefore help to disentangle perceptual and process-related sources of behavioral variability. Ultimately, this can inform interventions aimed at improving human categorizations (e.g., diagnosis training) by indicating which steps of the categorization mechanism to target.
